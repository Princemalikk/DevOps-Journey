# ðŸš€ My DevOps Journey Begins! 

I'm excited to start my **6-month DevOps learning journey**! ðŸŽ¯  
I'll be sharing my progress, key takeaways, and projects every week.  

To make this process more engaging, Iâ€™ll document my journey here on GitHub, as well as on Dev.to and LinkedIn and on Hashnode. My goal is to explore DevOps tools, automation, and best practices while building a strong learning community.
